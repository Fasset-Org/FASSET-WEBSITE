        This will enable Fasset to partner with public providers from
        Universities and Universities of Technology registered with DHET to
        ensure that learners are fully bursared in order to obtain formal
        qualifications that will ultimately enhance their chances of securing
        learnerships, internships or full time employment in the broader economy
        including in the Fasset sector.

        Fasset is currently in the process of establishing the parameters to
        issue bursaries to the “Missing Middle” as from January 2017 and is
        working with Universities and Universities of Technology registered with
        DHET to finalise.

        This enables Fasset to identify young learners who have already
        completed a qualification aligned to scarce skills within the sector and
        are being hampered in achieving their full potential due to the
        financial burden that they are carrying.
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography textAlign="justify">
        The outcome of this intervention is that learners will be relieved of
        their financial burden, will be able to complete their learnerships
        without having to change jobs just for higher salaries to pay off their
        loans AND re-inject additional funding into the NSFAS pool which will
        enable additional learners to have access to full time study
        opportunities. In other words this intervention will have a double
        benefit to the post schooling system in that the Fasset sector will be
        able to access learners who are not as financially burdened as they were
        previously whilst also offering opportunities to new learners who are
        seeking to enter the higher education and training area who are
        financially constrained.

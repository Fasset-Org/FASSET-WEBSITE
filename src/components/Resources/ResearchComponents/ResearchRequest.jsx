        FASSET has developed a research policy for all stakeholders who would
        like to request information from FASSET to be used for research
        purposes. This policy was developed to ensure that all stakeholders
        understand the process and procedures of FASSET when requesting this
        information. All stakeholders are encouraged to read through the policy
        before submitting any requests. The following criteria should be
        considered when requesting information and/or data from the SETA:

          "The objective for requesting the database must be in the best interests of the SETA and its members, and must provide value. For example, stakeholder consultation, free events.",

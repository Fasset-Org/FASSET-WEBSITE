        Workplace accreditation is a requirement for all employers, regardless
        of sector, who wishes to register learners on Fasset learnerships. The
        accreditation aims to verify the ability of the workplace to host a
        specific learnership. Criteria for accreditation include access to
        resources related to the learnership, the relevance of the work
        experience component to the qualification, and the structures in place
        to ensure successful implementation and completion of the learnership.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the majority of learnerships, Fasset has agreements with
        professional bodies and Assessment Quality Partners (AQPâ€™s) which are
        responsible for the accreditation of workplaces.

                any outstanding information, the learnership agreement will be
                returned to the employer, accompanied by a letter indicating
                reasons for non-registration. The employer may resubmit the
                learnership agreement, together with all required documentation
                If all the required documents are attached, Fasset will issue
